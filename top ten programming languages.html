Number of occupations: 18,000  

 

Normal yearly compensation: $97,000  

 

Advantages: Microsoft created C# as a quicker and safer variation of C. It is completely coordinated with Microsoft's .NET programming structure, which upholds the improvement of utilizations for Windows, program modules, and cell phones. C# offers shared codebases, a huge code library, and an assortment of information types.  

 

Downsides: C# can have a precarious expectation to learn and adapt, particularly for settling mistakes. It is less adaptable than dialects like C++.  

 

Normal uses: C# is the go-to language for Microsoft advertisement Windows application advancement. It can likewise be utilized for cell phones and computer game control center utilizing an expansion of the .NET Framework called Mono.  

 

5. C  

 

Number of occupations: 8,000  

 

Normal yearly compensation: $97,000  

 

Advantages: Along with Python and Java, C structures a "great establishment" for figuring out how to program, Gorton says. As one of the primary programming dialects at any point created, C has filled in as the establishment for composing more present day dialects like Python, Ruby, and PHP. It is additionally a simple language to troubleshoot, test, and keep up.  

 

Disadvantages: Since it's a more seasoned programming language, C isn't reasonable for more current use cases like sites or portable applications. C likewise has a mind boggling punctuation when contrasted with more present day dialects.  

 

Normal uses: Because it can run on a gadget, C is frequently used to program equipment, like inserted gadgets in vehicles and clinical gadgets utilized in medical care.  

 

6. C++  

 

Number of occupations: 9,000  

 

Normal yearly compensation: $97,000  

 

Advantages: C++ is an expansion of C that functions admirably for programming the frameworks that run applications, rather than the actual applications. C++ additionally functions admirably for multi-gadget and multi-stage frameworks. Over the long run, developers have composed a huge arrangement of libraries and compilers for C++. Having the option to utilize these utilities successfully is similarly as critical to understanding a programming language as composing code, Gorton says.  

 

Disadvantages: Like C, C++ has complex punctuation and a plenitude of highlights that can make it muddled for new software engineers. C++ additionally doesn't uphold run-time checking, which is a technique for identifying mistakes or deformities while programming is running.  

 

Regular uses: C++ has numerous utilizations and is the language behind everything from PC games to numerical reenactments.  

 

7. Go  

 

Number of occupations: 1,700  

 

Normal yearly compensation: $93,000  

 

Advantages: Also alluded to as Golang, Go was created by Google to be an effective, lucid, and secure language for framework level programming.
